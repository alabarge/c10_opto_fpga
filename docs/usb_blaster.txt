Arrow USB Programmer (JTAG server)
« on: January 13, 2022, 03:43:19 PM »
Hello,

I got a strange problem with the Arrow USB Programmer (JTAG server). Everything worked fine last time I used it, but since I had windows 10 updates it can no longer find the Arrow JTAG server in the the Windows Services.

I uninstalled and (re)installed the drivers and ran the "Arrow USB Programmer2 diagnostic" program and reported 1 error:
"Checking Altera JTAG server service.
- Error. The service is not installed. "

No JTAG service PID is found in the Windows Services list. How do i install the JTAG service manually?

Any ideas?

Regards,
BR

I found a solution to manually install the JTAG server again by using "quartus\bin64>jtagserver.exe -install" command. Somehow it uninstalled the JTAG server??? I have no idea why.

Now it works again!
